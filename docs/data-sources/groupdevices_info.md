# ome_groupdevices_info (Data Source)

This Terraform DataSource is used to query groups and their devices from OME. The information fetched from this data source can be used for getting the details for further processing in resource block.

# Get Group Info, Deviceids and servicetags of all devices that belong to a specified list of groups
data "ome_groupdevices_info" "gd" {
  device_group_names = ["WINDOWS", "WINDOWS-10"]
}

output "out" {
  value = {
    "common_device_ids"            = data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd.device_ids,
    "common_device_scvtags"        = data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd.device_servicetags,
    "group_windows"                = data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd.device_groups["WINDOWS"],
    "group_windows_subgroup_names" = data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd.device_groups["WINDOWS"].sub_groups[*].name,
    "group_windows_device_ids"     = data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd.device_groups["WINDOWS"].devices[*].id,
  }
}

# Get Sub Group Info of all specified groups
locals {
  # gd_names_with_non_zero_children is the subset of the specified list of group names where the group
  # has one or more child groups.
  # In the below code, we iterate over the specified list of groups and check if the sub_groups
  # field for that group in the ome_groupdevices_info data source has any entries. If it does, then that name is added
  # to a list. Then we use the to_set function to convert the list of names to a set to ensure that there is no 
  # duplication of names. Then that set is assigned to gd_names_with_non_zero_children.
  gd_names_with_non_zero_children = toset([for i in data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd.device_group_names : i if
  length(data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd.device_groups[i].sub_groups) > 0])
}

data "ome_groupdevices_info" "gd_children" {
  id                 = "1"
  device_group_names = data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd.device_groups[each.key].sub_groups[*].name
  for_each           = local.gd_names_with_non_zero_children
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing `terraform output` command.
Also, we can use the fetched information by the variable `data.ome_groupdevices_info.gd`

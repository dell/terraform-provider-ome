// Get the details of the device compliance report from device id, service tag or group name
data "ome_device_compliance_report" "device_compliance_report_data" {
  // This will get the device compliance report for devices based on the filters used. 
  // Only one of the below filters can be used at a time.
  # device_ids = [10102]
  # device_service_tags = ["HRPB0M3"]
  # device_group_names = ["Servers"]
}

output "device_compliance_report_data" {
  value = data.ome_device_compliance_report.device_compliance_report_data
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing `terraform output` command.

# Resource to manage all devices
resource "ome_devices" "dev_list_1" {
}

# Resource to manage specific devices
resource "ome_devices" "dev_list_2" {
  devices = [
    {
      service_tag = "ABCD34"
    },
    {
      id = 2000
    },
    # removing this block will remove device with service tag `QWX321` from the OME
    {
      service_tag = "QWX321"
    }
  ]
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, devices would have been updated on the OME. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

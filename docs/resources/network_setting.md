### Nested Schema for `adapter_setting.dns_configuration`

Optional:

- `dns_domain_name` (String) Static DNS domain name. This is applicable when "use_dhcp_for_dns_domain_name" is false.
- `dns_name` (String) DNS name for "hostname". This is applicable when "register_with_dns" is true.

Optional:

- `enable_dhcp` (Boolean) Enable or disable the automatic request to get an IPv4 address from the IPv4 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. If enable_dhcp option is true, OpenManage Enterprise retrieves the IP configurationâ€”IPv4 address, subnet mask, and gateway from a DHCP server on the existing network.

- `static_ip_address` (String) Static IPv4 address. This option is applicable when "enable_dhcp" is false.
- `static_preferred_dns_server` (String) Static IPv4 DNS preferred server. This option is applicable when "use_dhcp_for_dns_server_names" is false.
- `static_subnet_mask` (String) Static IPv4 subnet mask address. This option is applicable when "enable_dhcp" is false.
- `use_dhcp_for_dns_server_names` (Boolean) This option allows to automatically request and obtain a DNS server IPv4 address from the DHCP server. This option is applicable when "enable_dhcp" is true.

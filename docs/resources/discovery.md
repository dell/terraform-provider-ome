Resource for managing discovery on OpenManage Enterprise.




<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `discovery_config_targets` (Attributes Set) - Provide the list of discovery targets.
      			- Each discovery target is a set of "network_address_detail", "device_types", and one or more protocol credentials. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--discovery_config_targets))
- `name` (String) Name of the discovery configuration job

### Optional

- `community_types_string` (Boolean) - Enable the use of SNMP community strings to receive SNMP traps using Application Settings in OpenManage Enterprise. 
				- This option is available only for the discovered iDRAC servers and MX7000 chassis.
- `cron` (String) Provide a cron expression based on Quartz cron format
- `email_recipient` (String) - Enter the email address to which notifications are to be sent about the discovery job status.
				- Configure the SMTP settings to allow sending notifications to an email address.
- `ignore_partial_failure` (Boolean) - Provides the option to ignore partial failures. 
				- Partial failures occur when there is a combination of both discovered and undiscovered IPs.
      			- If ignore_partial_failur is set to false, then the partial failure is not ignored, and the resource will error out.
      			- If ignore_partial_failur is set to true, then the partial failure is ignored.
      			- This option is only applicable if "job_wait" is set to true.
- `job_wait` (Boolean) Provides the option to wait for job completion
- `job_wait_timeout` (Number) The maximum wait time of job_wait in seconds. The job is tracked only for this duration.
- `schedule` (String) Provides the option to schedule the discovery job. If `RunLater` is selected, then attribute `cron` must be specified.
- `trap_destination` (Boolean) - Enable OpenManage Enterprise to receive the incoming SNMP traps from the discovered devices. 
				- This is effective only for servers discovered by using their iDRAC interface.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) ID of the discovery configuration group

### Nested Schema for `discovery_config_targets`

Required:

- `device_type` (List of String) - Provide the type of devices to be discovered.

				- SERVER - "redfish", "snmp", and "ssh".
				- CHASSIS - "redfish".
				- NETWORK SWITCH - "snmp".
				- STORAGE - "snmp".
- `network_address_detail` (List of String) - "Provide the list of IP addresses, host names, or the range of IP addresses of the devices to be discoveredor included."
         		- "Sample Valid IP Range Formats"
         		- "   192.35.0.0"
